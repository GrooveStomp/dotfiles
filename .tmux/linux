# fool the multiplexers into thinking that the terminal has no "alternate
# screen" mode (such as that used by pico, mutt, etc). This is accomplished by
# setting termcap commands for the session.
# The 'xterm*' part of the command should be set to whatever your
# terminal-emulator is declared as.
# The end result is that the overflow ends up in the terminal's scrollback
# buffer instead of disappearing. Of course, since this is one static buffer,
# things will get messy as you switch between screen or tmux windows, but this
# is handy for quickly flicking up to see the output of an ls command or the
# such.
